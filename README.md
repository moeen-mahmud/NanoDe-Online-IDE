Tiny and Minimal Code Editor supports multiple languages

## Table of Contents

## Overview

NanoDe is a tiny and minimal code editor. It supports multiple languages and has a simple UI. Primarily built with React, Material UI, and Monaco Editor. It uses [Judge0](https://judge0.com/) for code compilations under the hood.

### The Challenge

The challenge was to develop a minimal code editor with multiple language supports. This editor should have

- A simple UI
- Some basic customization options like, font face, font size, theme vice-versa.
- A user can search from the language selectors. The language list might be huge so, it better to implement a search functionality.
- It should have a intuiting code editor interface with minimum support for highlighting, auto-completion, and code snippets.
- There should be a `STDIN` and `STDOUT` section to show the input and output of the code.
